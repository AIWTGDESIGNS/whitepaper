White paper exposing the main thesis behind AI WTG DESIGNS

The white Paper is a formal definition of the AI WTG DESIGNS thesis, originally by Imad Abdallah with contributions 
from many people around the world.

## Nomenclature
* WTG: Wind Turbine Generator
* AI: Artificial intelligence
* ML: Machine Learning
* UQ: Uncertainty Quantification

## Recreacting the wheel - yeah why not?!

## Minimizing resrouce consumption
Traditional companies – in fact, traditional corporations, period – will never solve our environmental problems. Publicly listed companies are driven by shareholder returns, shareholder returns by profits, and profits by selling as many goods (WTGs) as possible – and, therefore, using up as many natural resources as possible. “Your interest is maximising resource consumption. That’s what maximises your profit.”

So rather than do the above, let us do something a bit different even if it means recreating the wheel in certain instances.

## Informing design via continuous smart measurements, AI, Machine augmented learning, UQ and probabilistic approaches.

## Open sourcing and decentralizing research and engineering in WTG design

## Adopt the future. Period.
### Crypto tokens and the Blockchain
The  decentralized collaborative is exploring how crypto tokens can be used for engineering, research and collaboration on WTG projects, how the Blockchain can be used for distributed data storage and sharing, and how the Blockchain can be used for the emergence of scientific consensus and tracking the evolution of research output and usage. 

### 3D Printing for small WTG
Maximizing the utility of rapid 3D Printed components for WTG, and testing the feasibility and scalability of 3D printing technologies for large WTG components.
