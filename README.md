White paper exposing the main thesis behind AI WTG DESIGNS

The white Paper is a formal definition of the AI WTG DESIGNS thesis, originally by Imad Abdallah with contributions 
from many people around the world.

## Nomenclature
* WTG: Wind Turbine Generator
* AI: Artificial intelligence
* ML: Machine Learning
* UQ: Uncertainty Quantification

## Minimizing resrouce consumption
Traditional WTG OEM – in fact, traditional corporations, period – will never solve our environmental problems. Publicly listed companies are driven by shareholder returns, shareholder returns by profits, and profits by selling as many goods (WTGs) as possible – and, therefore, using up as many natural resources as possible. “Your interest is maximising resource consumption. That’s what maximises your profit.”

So rather than do the above, let us do something a bit different even if it means recreating the wheel in certain instances.

<!------------------------------------------------------------->
## Recreacting the wheel - yeah why not?!


## Informing design via continuous smart measurements, AI, Machine augmented learning, UQ and probabilistic approaches.


<!------------------------------------------------------------->
## Open sourcing and decentralizing research and engineering in WTG design
### Open source WTG for prototyping & testing
Ever been frustrated with lack of access to a real full scale WTG measurements to verify and validate your numerical models? Ever been frustrated with being denied access to a real full scale WTG platform to test your latest control features, or sensor or aerodynamic enhancing gadget, or hardware, or software, etc.? AI WTG DESIGNS owns and manages a sub 10kW 16.5 meters rotor diameter (variable speed variable pitch) open source WTG for prototyping & testing to solve the aforementioned frustrating situations. The open source WTG is very representative of modern WTGs, but in small size!

<!------------------------------------------------------------->
## Adopt the future. Period.
### Crypto tokens and the Blockchain
The  decentralized collaborative is exploring how crypto tokens can be used for engineering, research and collaboration on WTG projects, how the Blockchain can be used for distributed data storage and sharing, and how the Blockchain can be used for the emergence of scientific consensus and tracking the evolution of research output and usage. 

### 3D Printed components
Maximizing the utility of rapid 3D Printed components for WTG, and testing the feasibility and scalability of 3D printing technologies for large WTG components.
